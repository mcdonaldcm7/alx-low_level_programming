# Project - 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## General
- What is search algorithm 
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## About
This project is an to introduction to search algorithms which are algorithms
designed to solve search problems. Search algorithms work to retrieve information
stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a
problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

## More Info
There are tasks that demand we (ALX Students) write files containing big O notations.
The format used is:
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n\*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- ...
